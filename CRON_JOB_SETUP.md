---

## 📊 Monitoring Dashboard

All cron-triggered emails are logged to your admin dashboard:

**Location:** Admin → Email Marketing → 📧 Reminders tab

**Widget: "Automated Email Activity"**
- Shows last 10 automated sends
- Success/failure rates
- Timestamps
- Authentication source (Auto vs. Manual)

**Widget: "Email Queue Monitor"**
- Real-time queue status (pending, sending, sent, failed)
- Current queue size and processing rate
- Failed email retry counts
- Permanently failed emails requiring attention

**Location:** Admin → Email Marketing → 📬 Queue tab

**Realtime Updates:**
- Dashboard updates automatically when new emails are sent
- Queue monitor refreshes every 30 seconds
- No need to refresh the page

---

## 🔒 Security Features

**Authentication:**
- Cron token authentication (32+ character random string)
- Token stored in Supabase secrets (encrypted)
- Token sent via header (not URL) to prevent logging

**Monitoring:**
- All sends logged to `audit_logs` table
- Failed sends trigger security alerts
- IP addresses logged (for security auditing)

**Rate Limiting:**
- Emails sent in batches of 10
- 1-second delay between batches
- Prevents overwhelming email service

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Authentication required" error

**Solution:**
1. Verify `x-cron-token` header is correct
2. Check token has no extra spaces
3. Confirm `supabase/config.toml` has `verify_jwt = false`

### Issue: Emails not sending

**Solution:**
1. Check Resend domain is verified: https://resend.com/domains
2. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Supabase secrets
3. Check edge function logs for errors

### Issue: No logs in dashboard

**Solution:**
1. Verify job executed successfully
2. Check response status (should be 200)
3. Refresh admin dashboard
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: High unsubscribe rate (>5%)

**Solution:**
1. Reduce email frequency
2. A/B test subject lines
3. Add preference center (let users choose frequency)
4. Segment audience by engagement level

### Issue: Emails stuck in queue (pending status)

**Solution:**
1. Verify Email Queue Processor cron job is running
2. Check edge function logs for `process-email-queue`
3. Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set correctly
4. Check failed emails for error messages
5. If stuck >30 minutes, manually run queue processor

### Issue: Sunday emails sending when disabled

**Solution:**
1. Verify toggle is OFF in Admin → Email Marketing → Automation
2. Check `email_campaign_settings` table for `sunday_emails_enabled` value
3. Edge function should skip sending if setting is false
4. Check audit logs for Sunday email activity
