# API Key Rotation Guide

## Overview

This document provides step-by-step procedures for rotating API keys used in the application. Regular key rotation is a critical security practice that limits the impact of potential key compromises.

## Rotation Schedule

| Key Name | Rotation Interval | Criticality | Service |
|----------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| OPENAI_API_KEY | 90 days | Critical | AI Chat Features |
| RESEND_API_KEY | 90 days | Critical | Email Delivery |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | 90 days | Critical | Payment Processing |
| PERPLEXITY_API_KEY | 90 days | Standard | AI Search |
| SPARKLOOP_API_KEY | 180 days | Standard | Newsletter Growth |
| BEEHIVE_API_KEY | 180 days | Standard | Newsletter Integration |
| CRON_SECRET_TOKEN | 180 days | Standard | Scheduled Jobs |

## General Rotation Process

### Before Rotation

1. **Schedule during low-traffic periods** - Rotate keys during off-peak hours
2. **Notify team members** - Alert relevant team members before rotation
3. **Verify backup access** - Ensure you have admin access to all services
4. **Test in staging** - If available, test the new key in staging first

### During Rotation

1. Generate new key in the service provider's dashboard
2. Update the secret in Lovable Cloud / Supabase Secrets
3. Verify the application works with the new key
4. Monitor logs for any errors

### After Rotation

1. Mark the key as rotated in the Admin Dashboard
2. Revoke or delete the old key from the service provider
3. Document any issues encountered

### Perplexity API Key (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY)

**Location**: [Perplexity API Settings](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)

1. Log in to Perplexity
2. Go to API Settings
3. Generate a new API key
4. Update in Lovable Cloud Secrets
5. Test AI resource discovery features
6. Revoke the old key

### SparkLoop API Key (SPARKLOOP_API_KEY)

**Location**: SparkLoop Dashboard

1. Log in to SparkLoop
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Generate new API key
4. Update in Lovable Cloud Secrets
5. Verify newsletter referral tracking works
6. Revoke old key

---

### Beehive API Key (BEEHIVE_API_KEY)

---

### CRON Secret Token (CRON_SECRET_TOKEN)

**Location**: Self-generated token

1. Generate a new secure random token:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
2. Update in Lovable Cloud Secrets
3. Update any cron job configurations that use this token
4. Test scheduled jobs are still working

---

## Emergency Rotation

If you suspect a key has been compromised:

1. **Immediately revoke the compromised key** at the service provider
2. Generate a new key
3. Update in Lovable Cloud Secrets
4. Monitor logs for suspicious activity
5. Check for unauthorized usage in the service provider's dashboard
6. Document the incident

## Monitoring & Alerts

The Admin Dashboard includes an API Security tab that:
- Shows all tracked API keys
- Displays days until next rotation
- Alerts when keys are overdue for rotation
- Logs all rotation events for audit purposes

## Best Practices

1. **Never share keys** - Each environment should have its own keys
2. **Use least privilege** - Create keys with minimum required permissions
3. **Monitor usage** - Regularly check API usage for anomalies
4. **Document rotations** - Always log when and why keys were rotated
5. **Test thoroughly** - Always verify functionality after rotation
6. **Have a backup plan** - Know how to quickly revert if issues arise

## Troubleshooting

### Key not working after rotation
1. Wait 1-2 minutes for propagation
2. Verify the key was copied correctly (no extra spaces)
3. Check the key has proper permissions
4. Review edge function logs for specific errors

### Service degradation after rotation
1. Immediately roll back to old key if still valid
2. If old key was revoked, generate a new one
3. Check service provider status page
4. Contact support if issues persist

## Contact

For urgent key rotation issues, contact the platform administrator immediately.
